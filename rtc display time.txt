This code snippet is a Python script designed to read the time from a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module connected to a microcontroller board via the I2C communication protocol. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries. machine library is commonly used in MicroPython for hardware-related functionalities, and utime library provides functions for working with time.
Define the I2C Bus: The I2C bus is defined using the I2C class from the machine module. The scl and sda pins are specified for clock and data lines respectively.
RTC Address: The address of the RTC module (RTC_ADDR) is specified. The RTC module in this case is assumed to be an RTC3231, which commonly uses the address 0x68 on the I2C bus.
Read RTC Time Function: A function named read_rtc_time() is defined to read the time from the RTC module. This function sends a command byte to set the RTC register pointer to the time, reads 7 bytes of data from the RTC module, and then extracts the time components (hours, minutes, and seconds) from the received data. It also calls another function bcd_to_decimal() to convert Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format to decimal format for each time component.
BCD to Decimal Conversion Function: The bcd_to_decimal() function converts a BCD value to its decimal equivalent. BCD is a way of representing decimal numbers in binary form. This function extracts the tens and ones digits from the BCD value and converts them to decimal using simple arithmetic.
Main Loop: The script enters an infinite loop (while True) where it continuously reads the time from the RTC using the read_rtc_time() function, prints the time to the console in a human-readable format (hh:mm:ss), and then waits for 1 second (utime.sleep(1)) before repeating the process.
Overall, this code enables the microcontroller to retrieve the current time from an RTC module connected via the I2C bus and display it in the console output, providing a basic real-time clock functionality.
